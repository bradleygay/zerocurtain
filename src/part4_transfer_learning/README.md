# Part IV: Transfer Learning & Domain Adaptation

## Overview
Integration of in situ (PINSZC) and remote sensing (PIRSZC) zero-curtain 
detections through transfer learning and domain adaptation.

## Status
ðŸš§ **In Development** - Placeholder for Part IV implementation

## Planned Features
- Domain adaptation from in situ to satellite scale
- Transfer learning from Part II GeoCryoAI model
- Multi-scale fusion architecture
- Uncertainty quantification across domains

## Future Work
To be implemented after Part III completion.
