# Part III: Remote Sensing Zero-Curtain Detection (PIRSZC)

## Overview
Physics-informed detection of zero-curtain events using satellite remote sensing data.

## Status
ðŸš§ **In Development** - Placeholder for Part III implementation

## Planned Features
- MODIS Land Surface Temperature integration
- Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter analysis
- Physics-informed constraints from Part I
- Spatial scaling from point to pixel

## Future Work
To be implemented after Part II validation.
