###### Simulating and forecasting zero-curtain dynamics with the GeoCryoAI framework. Permafrost landscapes store approximately 1700 billion metric tons of organic carbon - nearly twice atmospheric levels - yet reservoir stability depends on the zero-curtain, a subsurface thermal plateau that emerges when latent heat flux maintains soil temperatures near 0°C during freeze-thaw phase transitions (Gay et al., 2025). Similarly, zero-curtain phenomena sustain liquid water availability via cryosuction within the active layer, enabling microbial activity to persist well into the cold season while regulating permafrost thermal stability. Zero-curtain intensity, duration, and spatial extent remain inadequately quantified during transitional seasons when isothermal buffering exhibits maximum variability, limiting our understanding of permafrost-climate feedbacks (Gay et al., 2025).
###### GeoCryoAI is hybridized Transformer-based U-Net-integrated Liquid Neural Network architecture (Kumar et al., 2023). GeoCryoAI) established multi-scale spatiotemporal learning with attention heads, physics-constrained loss functions, and computational optimization via MPS acceleration and Bayesian optimization. These process-based data-driven approaches demonstrate how AI/ML can resolve hidden geophysical information (i.e., permafrost-carbon feedback, localized warming patterns; Gay et al., 2025). GeoCryoAI integrates teacher-forced networks with bidirectional thermodynamic regularization and valid scaling and generalizability (i.e., Stefan's equation, Fourier's law). Our approach integrates in situ measurements and remote sensing observations; PI data harmonization; model development and synthesis;; and operational deployment protocol (Gay et al., 2025). Successful implementation delivers: (1) first-order high-resolution zero-curtain predictions generated at 30 m and aggregated to 0.05º grid cells and subsequent circumarctic distribution maps delineating thaw subsidence patterns, which may help improve quantification and reconciliation of cold-season GHG emissions and close the Arctic carbon budget; (2) operational NISAR integration, scalability, and processing pipeline protocols; and (3) novel insights into feedback; (3) mechanisms, spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the zero-curtain, and future implications for the permafrost carbon feedback (PCF; (Gay et al., 2025).
